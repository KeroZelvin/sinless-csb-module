# This script sets ENVARS we'll use throughout the GitLab CI pipeline.
# We set them during the 'init' job via this script rather than in
# .gitlab-ci.yml so we can conditionally set them as needed and all the
# logic is in one place.

# NOTE: All exported ENVARs MUST be uppercase!
#       Do NOT start ENVARs with 'CI_' as they are skipped in testing.

# GitLab Variables
##################
# Variables that are set by GitLab CI environment
# CI_API_V4_URL, CI_PROJECT_ID, CI_COMMIT_TAG

# Set CI_COMMIT_TAG to "" if it does not exist as we use this to
# determine if we're tagging a release.

##################
# System Variables
##################
# Variables directly related to the system and using by Gulp
# When adding/removing/changing these you MUST also update
# the 'gulp/conststants.mjs' file.

# SYSTEM_NAME is the Foundry system ID, used for paths etc.
SYSTEM_NAME="cyberpunk-red-core"

# SYSTEM_TITLE (display name for system in Foundry)
SYSTEM_TITLE="Cyberpunk RED - CORE"

# System manifest
SYSTEM_FILE="system.json"

# Changelog file

########################
# Build System Variables

# Variables that rarely change, can be overwritten later.

# Base URL for the project

###################
# Dynamic Variables
###################
# Variables that need to be overwritten depending on the job needs.

# If the CI_COMMIT_TAG is empty we're probably merging to dev so
# overwite the defaults. Used in the build stages.

# Derived Variables
###################
# Mostly static variables that rely on Dynamic Variables before being set.
