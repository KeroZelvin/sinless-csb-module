A murky haze covers a radius of 4 meters (2\") per point of force. All who are within this field, are assaulted by dark tentacles covered in eyes, hair, and oozing open sores. There are 1d6+Force tentacles in this area that make melee attacks each round. They have a <span style=\"font-family:'Bruno Ace', sans-serif;\">Brawn</span> pool of 5 and do 3 damage. On the caster's turn, including the turn, the spell was successfully cast, the tentacles all attack targets within the haze chosen by the caster. Any person moving through the area without a melee weapon or firing a weapon is subject to one free attack by a tentacle, not one per tentacle. The tentacles are immune to destruction and damage. The tentacles beg and plead for you to help them.</p>",
