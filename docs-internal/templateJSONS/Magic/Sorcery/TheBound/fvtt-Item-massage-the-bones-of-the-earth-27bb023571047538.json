During combat, it can be used to raise a barrier 2 m in width and 1 m in height per point of force. E.g. a force six massage the bones of the earth can be used to raise a barrier up to 12 m (6\") wide and 6 m (3 \") high. The barrier has armor equal to 4. The barrier need not be contiguous, but no section can be smaller than 2 m in width and 1 m high. The barrier can be shaped as the caster wishes to the extent that it is made of solid blocks of stone or concrete and re-bar. This may also be used to precisely and permanently shape one cubic meter of stone per point of force.</p>",
