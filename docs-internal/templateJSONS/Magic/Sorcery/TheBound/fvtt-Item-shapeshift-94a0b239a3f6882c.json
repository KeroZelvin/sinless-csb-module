For the duration of the spell, the caster may switch between any of the animal forms they have selected as a complex action. Each time they shift, they heal 1d6 boxes of damage from both their physical and stun condition track. See animals in Chapter 10 for animal statistics. You may not speak or cast spells while shapeshifted. You can add an additional animal form known per point of force learned of the spell.</p>",
