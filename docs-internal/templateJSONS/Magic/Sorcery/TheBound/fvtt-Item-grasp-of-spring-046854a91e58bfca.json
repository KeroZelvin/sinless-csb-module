Plants reach out and tie people down, cables and wires writhe and grapple, and the ground grows up grabbing trapping feet. Anyone who fails their resistance test is immobile. Even if the targets succeed in their resistance test, the terrain is difficult, costing double to move through. Anyone entering or beginning their turn within the area must resist the spell anew or be immobilized.</p>",
