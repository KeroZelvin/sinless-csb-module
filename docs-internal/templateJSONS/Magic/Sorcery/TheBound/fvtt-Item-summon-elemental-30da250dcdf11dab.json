It is half a meter in height for each point of force. The elemental has a cohesion condition track equal to twice the force of the spell. You gain an exploit action to command the elemental, and it acts as a cohort. The elemental follows any direction you wish. It can attack, move, and take any action commanded. It can roll a number of dice to attack, dodge, and soak equal to the force of the spell. The damage on a melee or ranged attack with its element is 3 + net successes in damage to the opponent's physical wound track.</p><p><em><<Using an elemental spirit to attack opponents is possibly the most useless thing you can do with it. It's literally an animated element!>> --NeoAlpacaMan</em></p>",
