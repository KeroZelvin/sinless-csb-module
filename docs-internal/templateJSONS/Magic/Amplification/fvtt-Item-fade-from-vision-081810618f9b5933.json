You are visible, but their eyes won't communicate to the brain what they see. That target is penalized six dice on all tests against you. It takes a complex action to switch targets. Out of combat, you can be detected by an <span style=\"font-family:'Bruno Ace', sans-serif;\">Observation</span> test, versus your <span style=\"font-family:'Bruno Ace', sans-serif;\">Shadow</span> test. You must be able to see your target to vanish from their vision.</p>",
