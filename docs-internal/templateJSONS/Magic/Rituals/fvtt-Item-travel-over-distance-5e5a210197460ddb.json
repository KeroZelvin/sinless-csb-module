It takes one hour to perform. On a result of no successes, you will reappear... elsewhere, lucky if not stuck inside another object. The drain affects everyone who is using the spell to travel. You can only travel to a place you know well and have specifically enchanted and prepared with ten manastelliate.</p>"
